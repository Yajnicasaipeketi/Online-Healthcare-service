what if I say severity range 1-5 is less, mild , moderate, high, very high respectively ; duration of 1 to 5 days means short-term, more than 5 days to two months means medium-term and more than two months means long-term ; frequency rare means twice a year , sometimes means 3 to 8 times a year and more than 8 times a year means often. Now can you see all the diseases and as an expert chatbot, I wan to you to provide me values for every disease more carfully for more accurate model
